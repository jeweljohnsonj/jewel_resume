  My name is Jewel Johnson, and I am pleased to share with you some information about myself. I am an incoming Ph.D. student at Ball State University, Indiana, USA, and I am thrilled to begin my research on embryonic social learning using fathead minnow fish as a model organism. My passion for the study of animal behavior drives me to understand the underlying factors that drive certain behaviors and their ecological implications. Moreover, I have gained significant experience in R programming, particularly in data visualization, data wrangling, and statistical modeling. As a personal endeavor, I have begun to document my acquired skills through tutorial-style blog posts. Not only does this exercise enhance my English writing skills, but it also facilitates my own learning process while benefiting others through sharing my knowledge. In my free time, I enjoy engaging in photography, playing video games, and participating in indoor sports, such as badminton.

           Visual ecology of the Giant Honey Bee (Apis dorsata)
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            This project was carried out under the supervision of [Prof. Hema Somanathan](https://faculty.iisertvm.ac.in/beelab/). The Giant Honeybee (*Apis dorsata*) is known to be facultative nocturnal species of bees who occasionally forage on flowers during crepuscular and full-moon periods. Despite having day-adapted eyes, it is not known how *A. dorsata* can forage in low light conditions. So my project was aimed at understanding the visual ecology *A. dorsata*.

            During this project, I developed a novel training paradigm for training *A. dorsata* as they are open nesting species that are quite aggressive and cannot be reared or handled in a controlled lab environment. I performed classical conditioning and Y-maze experiments and, conducted video observations. I learned how to use the software [BORIS](http://www.boris.unito.it/) for video analysis. Data analysis and data visualization was done using R.

            For this project, I managed and stored around 100 different species of insect specimens and performed basic morphometric measurements on them using the [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/features.html) software.

          Investigating the role of phenylalanine in the Asian Honeybee (Apis cerana)
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            It is known that honeybees rely on pollen as their primary source of protein and we also know that flowers which are primarily pollinated by honeybees contain a cocktail of amino acids in their nectar. In this project, I investigated the role of phenylalanine, an essential amino acid for honeybees in terms of learning in the Asian Honeybee (*Apis cerana*).

            During this project, I performed classical conditioning experiments and did data analysis using R.

          Visual associative learning and olfactory preferences of the Greater Banded Hornet (Vespa tropica)
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            The Greater Banded Hornet (*Vespa tropica*) is a hymenopteran predator who is declared as an invasive species by many countries in Europe. They are also generalists who employ a wide variety of foraging strategies which makes them excellent model organisms to study cognition and vision.

            In this study, I performed classical conditioning experiments to study colour and shape learning abilities in *V. tropica*. Later I checked their olfactory preferences by performing a dual choice experiment. The data from the experiments were analyzed using R. I also received first-hand experience in writing the manuscript of this study which was later published in [2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00040-021-00820-w). The study also garnered media attention from [The Wire Science](https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/greater-banded-hornets-vespa-tropica-miriam-lehrer-hema-somanathan/).
